Hello and Welcome to GoldMine - the Quest for Alcohol Poisoning! 

There is a makefile to compile everything using gcc, it's written in c++, and it's a small game that's easy to lose and winning has no sense of accomplishment. You simply pick and choose random spaces on a board and if you find the right one, you win, and if you find the wrong one, you lose. It's essentially minesweeper but it doesn't tell you where the other mines are.

Having said that all, please enjoy!
